# Kanban Board

We have a broken and unfinished client-server kanban board web app. HALP! Please fix it! :)

## Missing features (do as many as you can):

- **fetch tasks from the API** reachable at `/api` (see the Express server in the `/server` folder for details)
- **make tasks clickable**; on click tasks should advance to the next column; in the "done" column tasks are no longer clickable

## Some things to know

- codesandbox doesn't do auto-refresh in this case, please refresh manually
- if imports are highlighted in red, please wait, open another file, then reopen the initial file
